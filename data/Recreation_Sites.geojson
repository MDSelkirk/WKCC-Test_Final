Now, anglers keep the tread open as they climb the steep trail to Panther Lake, where they share the fishing with osprey. At the far end of Panther Lake, a terminal moraine creates a peninsula that is perfect to cast from. There is a good trail around the lake.\r\n\r\nHikers and history buffs can still find traces of the original trail that the old miners used as they led their pack animals over the pass at the end of Panther Lake. Listen for whistling marmots as you work your way up these passes. Ridge walkers will enjoy the Three Sisters Peaks.\r\n\r\nSet at the foot of the Three Sisters Peaks, Panther Lake, with rock slides to it's shores and sub-alpine forests surrounding it, is truly beautiful.

Altitude changes on the trails on the North/West side of the creek are gradual. The greatest elevation change is approximately 1500' over about 2.5 miles. The trails on the South/East side of the creek are pretty flat. For some, the many crossings of Trapping Creek can be challenging during the height of spring runoff, which is usually short but powerful and depends on the snowpack melt.\r\nThere are 3 camp areas along the Trapping Creek FSR. Each will allow for 3 truck/trailer rigs to comfortably fit. Access to the campsites are on a first come-first serve basis. Other recreational campers also utilize these sites and in the late fall the area is very popular with hunters. \r\n\r\nThe camping areas are primitive, but all have rock fire-pits. You will need to bring your own water as the creeks, while close by, aren't close enough for packing water. The 3 camps along the FSR also all have lovely shady areas for your horses. Lots of room for setting up pens and hi-lining at all camps. Don't be surprised to see bovine visitors in any of the camps! They do come by to say hello from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe Trapping Creek is only a 5-10 minute walk from each of these 3 camps. There is firewood available, some on the ground and some dead standing. No shortage, but you will have to work for it. Bring your chainsaw. These camps can be a bit dusty during dry weather since they are right beside the Trapping Creek FSR, which is well-used by other Back Country enthusiasts and is active logging going on in the area on weekdays.\r\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -119.046452453224347, 49.572060779985684 ] } },

Take a few minutes to explore the original hot spring development. Old pools, cement foundations and rock walls hint at what once was. Behind the largest pool, a brown 4x4 post marks the beginning of the Kimbol Lake trail. After a short steep pitch, the trail takes a more moderate grade as it climbs steadily through a tranquil cedar and hemlock forest with an understorey of mosses and shade loving plants.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 km from the parking lot, the trail crosses a logging road before entering the Kimbol Creek drainage. Look across the valley and see if you can pick out the old growth stand, known as the \"Cedar Grove\". As the trail ascends Kimbol Creek the pitch steepens, finally levelling out as it enters a stand of old growth hemlock and cedar just before the lake.\r\n\r\nKimbol Lake is a long narrow lake, squeezed between 2 steep sided mountains.
